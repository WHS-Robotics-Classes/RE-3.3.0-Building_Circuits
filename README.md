# :robot: Building Circuits

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

In a previous lab, you created a schematic from three different circuts.  In this example you will practice building circuits from a schematic, including debugging a circuit. 🚀

## Background Practice

Before constructing a circuit, read the [Section 3.3](https://roboticsengineeringcourse.github.io/electrical-concepts.html#circuits) of our online text.  Be sure to read over the page from the All About Circuits textbook and complete at least questions 1-5 on the worksheet.  That should give you plenty of background along with what you learned in [Sectopm 3.1](https://roboticsengineeringcourse.github.io/electrical-concepts.html#schematics) about schematics.
